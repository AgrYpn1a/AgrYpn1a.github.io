# Setup

In this section we are going to setup our programming environment. As this course is written for C# there will be two ways to follow it. If you're on `Windows` this setup will be pretty straightforward using [Visual Studio Community](http://localhost), otherwise you will have to follow a different kind of setup using a `.NET Core` which is compatible accross different platforms such as `Linux` or `MacOS`.
