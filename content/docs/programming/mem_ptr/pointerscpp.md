# C++ Pointers

We have worked in C# so far, so you may wonder why C++ all of a sudden? The answer is simple, C# will allow us to work with references / pointers, however it will hide some details from us. To discover these details and to make things more clear, but also more confusing at first, we want to dive in and take a short detour to C++ to explore this subject in depth.

I promise, this will be very useful if understood correctly. It will take more time, and it is a bit more complex and requires some additional brain gymnastics but if you take the time to learn it now, you will never again have issues when working with references / pointers in any language. I have chosen C++ for this part, because the syntax is fairly similar to that of C# in most cases and because C++ setup is pretty straight-forward on all OSs.
