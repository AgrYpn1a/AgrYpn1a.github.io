"Hello world!" is a phrase that usually begins every programming tutorial or course out there. A program that prints this message on screen is typically the first program you will ever write when you start learning programming. As this is my first blog post I decided to follow that tradition here as well.

Whether you are an absolute beginner, computer science student or an already formed programmer I believe the material written here will be helpful for you. Although the main goal of this website is to help complete beginners learn programming, we will cover some more advanced topic here as well, providing both theory and practice.
