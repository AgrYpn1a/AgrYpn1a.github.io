We will assume that you already understand how arrays work, but a small reminder will be written here in the document.
We will start simple, and slowly work our way to more complex stuff. Once you are ready you can checkout more advanced practice here.</description></item><item><title>Binary Numbers</title><link>/docs/problems/beginner/binary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/problems/beginner/binary/</guid><description>Binary Numbers # In this chapter we are going to implement methods that help us work with binary numbers. First we are going to read binary numbers as strings from STD input stream, and then we are going to validate these strings to make sure that the input is actually a binary number. After that we will be able to do more fun stuff, such as converting a binary number to a decimal and vice versa, and more.</description></item></channel></rss>
