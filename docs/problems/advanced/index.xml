We are going to write a class that is like a library that allows us to work with arrays in a very useful way.
In this practice, we are going to assume that you are familiar with some basics of functional programming, as our approach to solving the problems given here will be functional-oriented. This means that do NOT want to modify the given inputs in any way, and always instead return the modified input from the function.</description></item></channel></rss>
