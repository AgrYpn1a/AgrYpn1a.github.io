A program that prints this message on screen is typically the first program you will ever write when you start learning programming. As this is my first blog post I decided to follow that tradition here as well.
Whether you are an absolute beginner, computer science student or an already formed programmer I believe the material written here will be helpful for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
